PART I

ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses.

Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil or XTO. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO, as well as terms like Corporation, Company, our, we  and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.

Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2016 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $4.9 billion, of which $3.5 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $5 billion in 2017 and 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total.

The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.

Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the following: “Quarterly Information”, “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and Related Information” and “Operating Information”. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report.

ExxonMobil has a long‑standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments. Information on Company‑sponsored research and development spending is contained in “Note 3: Miscellaneous Financial Information” of the Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil held nearly 12 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2016. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $104 million in 2016. Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.

The number of regular employees was 71.1 thousand, 73.5 thousand, and 75.3 thousand at years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs. Regular employees do not include employees of the company‑operated retail sites (CORS). The number of CORS employees was 1.6 thousand, 2.1 thousand, and 8.4 thousand at years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in CORS employees reflects the multi‑year transition of the company‑operated retail network to a more capital‑efficient Branded Wholesaler model.

Information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations may be found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Properties” in this report.

ExxonMobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file or furnish the reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also available on the Corporation’s website are the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of the Board of Directors. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include:

Supply and Demand

The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Upstream segment, financial condition and proved reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Downstream and Chemical segments.

Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil.

Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled or electric vehicles.

Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals.

Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. We generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures.

 

Government and Political Factors

ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.

Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin.

Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions.

Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.

2 

 

Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law (including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that could adversely affect our results, such as:

  

·           

increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims);

·           

price controls;

·           

changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations, water use, methane emissions, or hydraulic fracturing);

·           

adoption of regulations mandating the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;

·           

adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries; and

·           

government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.

Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.

We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations.

Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time.

Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.

Government sponsorship of alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, the University of Texas, and Stanford University. Our research projects focus on developing algae-based biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials and other technologies. For example, ExxonMobil is working with Fuel Cell Energy Inc. to explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture CO2 emissions from gas-fired power plants. Our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Management Effectiveness” below.

 

Management Effectiveness

In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.

Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget.

Project management. The success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses depends on complex, long‑term, capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role.

The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity‑based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees.

Research and development. To maintain our competitive position, especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities. We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended. The ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.

Business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, ExxonMobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or its business operations disrupted.

Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rain fall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning.

Projections, estimates, and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7 and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES

Information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows:

 

1. Disclosure of Reserves

A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2016

The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. As a result of very low prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Otherwise, no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2016, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.

The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long-term oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.

As noted above, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl. In addition, 0.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of North America no longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to the acceleration of the projected end-of-field-life. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. We do not expect the downward revision of reported proved reserves under SEC definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes.

B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2016

Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2016 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.

Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages.

In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.

C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves

ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the Global Reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in Engineering. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either Engineering or Geology. Several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise, and a member currently serves on the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.

The Global Reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.

 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves

At year-end 2016, approximately 6.2 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. This represents 31 percent of the 20 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 6.8 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2015. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 1 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year‑end. The largest transfers were related to the Gorgon LNG project start-up and drilling activity at Upper Zakum, Tengiz and in the United States. During 2016, extensions, primarily in the United States, resulted in an addition of approximately 0.4 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves.

Overall, investments of $10.1 billion were made by the Corporation during 2016 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $9.3 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional $0.8 billion for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments represented 70 percent of the $14.5 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. Investments made by the Corporation to develop quantities which no longer meet the SEC definition of proved reserves due to 2016 average prices are included in the $14.5 billion of Upstream capital expenditures reported above but are excluded from amounts related to progressing the development of proved undeveloped reserves.

One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production. However, the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, the United States, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Qatar, and Nigeria have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, the pace of co‑venturer/government funding, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. The largest of these is related to LNG/Gas projects in Australia, where construction of the Gorgon LNG project is in the final phases. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore Kashagan field which is included in the North Caspian Production Sharing Agreement and the Tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the Tengiz – Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the Netherlands, the Groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation of future stages of compression. These reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure.

Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor. Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies

Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2016, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 67 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.

Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.

Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced from open-pit mining operations, and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2016, average net production at Kearl was about 167 thousand barrels per day.

As a result of very low prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies.

Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 94 million barrels of oil and 2,500 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2017 through 2019. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property‑specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.

D. Summary of Acreage Terms

UNITED STATES

Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.

CANADA / SOUTH AMERICA

Canada

Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a maximum term of nine years. Production licenses in the offshore are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.

Argentina

The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in December 2014. The onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional concession, with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed.

EUROPE

Germany

Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.

Netherlands                                                                     

Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.

Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.

Norway

Licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial period of six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of at least one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year and another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. Licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period. Licenses issued after July 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period.

 
19 

 

United Kingdom

Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.

AFRICA

Angola

Exploration and production activities are governed by production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension.

Chad

Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is for 30 years and may be extended up to 50 years at the discretion of the government.

Equatorial Guinea

Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. A new PSC was signed in 2015; the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions available at the discretion of the Ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. The production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years.

Nigeria

Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended.

Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years, while in all other areas the licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.

OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further renewal option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.

OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months’ written notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration.

 
20 

 

 ASIA  

Azerbaijan

The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field is established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994.

Other exploration and production activities are governed by PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The exploration period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions.

Indonesia

Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50 percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms.

Iraq

Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with South Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.

Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as provided by the PSCs and at the discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in effect by agreement of the regional government to allow additional time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The production period is 20 years with the right to extend for five years.

Kazakhstan

Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.

Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions.

Malaysia

Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have terms ranging up to 29 years. All extensions are subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval. The total production period is 15 to 29 years, depending on the provisions of the respective contract.

Qatar

The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects.

Republic of Yemen

The Jannah production sharing agreement has a development period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which was made in June 1995. Due to force majeure events, the development period has been extended beyond its original expiration date by an additional 735 days, with the possibility of further extensions due to ongoing force majeure events.

 
21 

 

Russia

Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the production sharing agreement (PSA) that became effective in 1996 between the Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator. The term of the PSA is 20 years from the Declaration of Commerciality, which would be 2021. The term may be extended thereafter in ten-year increments as specified in the PSA.

Exploration and production activities in the Kara, Laptev, Chukchi and Black Seas are governed by joint venture agreements concluded with Rosneft in 2013 and 2014 that cover certain of Rosneft’s offshore licenses. The Kara Sea licenses covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in 2013 extend through 2040 and include an exploration period through 2020. Additional licenses in the Kara, Laptev and Chukchi Seas covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in 2014 extend through 2043 and include an exploration period through 2023. The Kara, Laptev and Chukchi Sea licenses require development plan submission within eight years of a discovery and development activities within five years of plan approval. The Black Sea exploration license extends through 2017 and a discovery is the basis for obtaining a license for production. Refer to the relevant portion of “Note 7: Equity Company Information” of the Financial Section of this report for additional information on the Corporation’s participation in Rosneft joint venture activities.

Thailand

The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil’s concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time.

United Arab Emirates

An interest in the development and production activities of the Upper Zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of January 2006, for a term expiring March 2026, and in 2013 the governing agreements were extended to 2041.

AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA

Australia

Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter “indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted “indefinitely”. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for five years.

Papua New Guinea

Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister’s discretion. Petroleum Retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of 15 years. Extensions of Petroleum Retention licenses may be for periods of less than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years.

ITEM 3.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On December 8, 2016, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) contacted the Corporation concerning alleged violations of the Texas Clean Air Act, certain implementing regulations, and the applicable new source review permit in connection with exceedances of the nitrogen oxide emission limit at a compressor engine and volatile organic compound emission limits at Tanks 21 and 23 at the Corporation’s former King Ranch Gas Plant. The TCEQ is seeking a civil penalty in excess of $100,000, and the Corporation is working with the TCEQ to resolve the matter.

PART II

ITEM 5.       MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Reference is made to the “Quarterly Information” portion of the Financial Section of this report.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

As previously reported in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, on July 21, 2016, the Corporation entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended and restated on December 15, 2016, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of InterOil Corporation (IOC) in exchange for consideration including around 28 million shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock. With respect to the shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction, the Corporation is relying on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.

As previously reported in the Corporation’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 17, 2017, on January 16, 2017, an affiliate of the Corporation entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) to acquire companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, that indirectly own certain oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin and certain additional properties and related assets in exchange for issuance to the sellers of shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock having an aggregate value at the time of closing of $5.6 billion. The number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock for this purpose will be determined based on the Corporation’s volume-weighted average trading price over a 10-day period ending on the third trading date immediately preceding the closing date. The transaction is currently expected to close on or about February 28, 2017. As of January 16, 2017, the number of shares issuable in connection with the transaction would have been approximately 63 million. The sale of shares under the PSA has been structured as a private placement solely to accredited investors and therefore the Corporation is relying on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

See “Note 20: Subsequent Events” of the Financial Section of this report for additional information regarding these transactions.

During the fourth quarter, the Corporation did not purchase any shares of its common stock for the treasury.

Note 1 - On August 1, 2000, the Corporation announced its intention to resume purchases of shares of its common stock for the treasury both to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to gradually reduce the number of shares outstanding. The announcement did not specify an amount or expiration date. The Corporation has continued to purchase shares since this announcement and to report purchased volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its earnings release dated February 2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with benefit plans and programs, but had suspended making purchases to reduce shares outstanding effective beginning the first quarter of 2016.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

 

Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.

Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales

Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed

Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

 

Return on Average Capital Employed

Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

OVERVIEW

The following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The Corporation’s business model involves the production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods.

ExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well‑positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. The company’s integrated business model, with significant investments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments, reduces the Corporation’s risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and demand, ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities. The corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Volumes are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Price ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized for investment evaluation purposes. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of economic scenarios. Once major investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future projects.




BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

Long-Term Business Outlook

By 2040, the world’s population is projected to grow to approximately 9 billion people, or about 1.8 billion more than in 2015. Coincident with this population increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 3 percent per year. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy will continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by about 25 percent from 2015 to 2040. This demand increase is expected to be concentrated in developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development).

As expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy‑efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission fuels will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy requirements for transportation, power generation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs.

Energy for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is expected to increase by about 25 percent from 2015 to 2040. The growth in transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Nearly all the world’s transportation fleets will continue to run on liquid fuels, which are abundant, widely available, easy to transport, and provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes.

Demand for electricity around the world is likely to increase approximately 60 percent from 2015 to 2040, led by a doubling of demand in developing countries. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest‑growing major segment of global energy demand. Meeting the expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set of energy sources. The share of coal‑fired generation is likely to decline to less than 30 percent of the world’s electricity in 2040, versus about 40 percent in 2015, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks of climate change. From 2015 to 2040, the amount of electricity generated using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely to approximately double, and account for 90 percent of the growth in electricity supplies. By 2040, coal, natural gas and renewables are projected to each be generating in the range of 25-30 percent of electricity worldwide, although significant differences will exist across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of energy types.

Liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of distribution, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2040, global demand for liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 112 million barrels of oil‑equivalent per day, an increase of about 20 percent from 2015. Much of this demand today is met by crude production from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important as significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels – are expected to grow significantly to meet rising demand. The world’s resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through

41 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic supply options. However, access to resources and timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable, affordable supplies.

Natural gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source from 2015 to 2040, meeting about 40 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand is expected to rise about 45 percent from 2015 to 2040, with about 45 percent of that increase in the Asia Pacific region. Helping meet these needs will be significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas ‑ the natural gas found in shale and other rock formations that was once considered uneconomic to produce. In total, about 60 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of supply, meeting about two‑thirds of global demand in 2040. Worldwide liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, likely reaching more than 2.5 times the level of 2015 by 2040, with much of this supply expected to meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.

The world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close to one‑third in 2040. Coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the 2025‑2030 timeframe. The share of natural gas is expected to reach 25 percent by 2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20 percent. Nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total renewable energy is likely to reach about 15 percent of total energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing over 200 percent from 2015 to 2040, when they will be about 4 percent of world energy.

The Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant. According to the International Energy Agency, the investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirements worldwide over the period 2016‑2040 will be about $23 trillion (measured in 2015 dollars) or approximately $900 billion per year on average.

International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into account policies established to reduce energy‑related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy, which is used as a foundation for assessing the business environment and business strategies and investments. The climate accord reached at the recent Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our Outlook  reflects increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook  seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies, which often target specific sectors, by using various assumptions and tools including application of a proxy cost of carbon to estimate potential impacts on consumer demands. For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2 emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per tonne on average in 2040 in OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. Thus, all practical and economically viable energy sources, both conventional and unconventional, will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy needs as well as the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people.

The information provided in the Long‑Term Business Outlook includes ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources including the International Energy Agency.

 

Upstream

ExxonMobil continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which enables the Corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s fundamental Upstream business strategies guide our global exploration, development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. These strategies include capturing material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade the resource portfolio, selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and applying high-impact technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate.

As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Oil equivalent production from North

42 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

America is expected to increase over the next several years based on current investment plans, contributing over a third of total production. Further, the proportion of our global production from resource types utilizing specialized technologies such as arctic, deepwater, unconventional drilling and production systems and LNG, is a slight majority of production and is expected to grow over the next few years. We do not anticipate that the expected change in the geographic mix of production volumes, and in the types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced, will have a material impact on the nature and the extent of the risks disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, or result in a material change in our level of unit operating expenses.

The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The upstream industry environment has been challenged in recent years with abundant crude oil supply causing crude oil prices to decrease to levels not seen since 2004, and natural gas prices declined with increased supply. However, current market conditions are not necessarily indicative of future conditions. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of global economic growth. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC and other large government resource owners, and other factors. To manage the risks associated with price, ExxonMobil evaluates annual plans and major investments across a range of price scenarios.

 

Downstream

ExxonMobil’s Downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and marketing complexes around the world. The Corporation has a presence in mature markets in North America and Europe, as well as in the growing Asia Pacific region.

ExxonMobil’s fundamental Downstream business strategies competitively position the company across a range of market conditions. These strategies include targeting best‑in‑class operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced technologies, capitalizing on integration across ExxonMobil businesses, selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and services to customers.

ExxonMobil’s operating results, as noted in Item 2. Properties, reflect 22 refineries, located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 4.9 million barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 126 thousand barrels per day. ExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes marketing businesses have significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base. Our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes Exxon, Mobil, Esso  and Mobil 1.  

While demand remained strong in 2016, margins weakened as surplus distillate and gasoline production capacity created high inventories. North American refineries which benefited from cost‑competitive feedstock and energy supplies saw lower margins as the differential between Brent and WTI narrowed after the elimination of the U.S. crude export ban. Margins in Europe and Asia weakened versus 2015, but reductions in supply and rising Asia demand kept those markets above bottom‑of‑cycle conditions seen in 2014. In the near term, we see variability in refining margins, with some regions seeing weaker margins as new capacity additions are expected to outpace growth in global demand for our products, which can also be affected by global economic conditions and regulatory changes.

Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). Crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather and political climate.

ExxonMobil’s long‑term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain subject to intense competition as new capacity additions outpace the growth in global demand. ExxonMobil’s integration across the value chain, from refining to marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.

As described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and other climate‑related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the Downstream business.

In the retail fuels marketing business, product cost volatility has contributed to a decline in margins. In 2016, ExxonMobil expanded its branded retail site network and progressed the multi‑year transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, company‑operated) retail network in portions of Europe and Canada to a more capital‑efficient Branded Wholesaler model. The company’s lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world‑class brands and integration with industry‑leading basestock

refining capability. ExxonMobil remains a market leader in the high‑value synthetic lubricants sector, despite increasing competition.

The Downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade. In 2016, the company divested its refinery in Torrance, California. When investing in the Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on selective and resilient projects. In 2016, construction continued on a new delayed coker unit at the refinery in Antwerp, Belgium, to upgrade low‑value bunker fuel into higher value diesel products. Construction also progressed on a proprietary hydrocracker at the refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to produce higher value ultra-low sulfur diesel and Group II basestocks. The Taicang, China, lubricants plant expansion was completed in April 2016, doubling the capacity of the facility. The Port Allen Aviation Lubricants Plant in Louisiana achieved full production during the year, and an expansion in Singapore is underway to support demand growth for finished lubricants in key markets. Finally, ExxonMobil announced plans to increase production of ultra-low sulfur fuels at the Beaumont, Texas, refinery by approximately 40,000 barrels per day.

 

Chemical

Worldwide petrochemical demand remained strong in 2016, led by growing demand from Asia Pacific manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. North America continued to benefit from abundant supplies of natural gas and gas liquids, providing both low‑cost feedstock and energy. Specialty product margins moderated in 2016 with capacity additions exceeding demand growth.

ExxonMobil sustained its competitive advantage through continued operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, and integration with refining and upstream operations, all underpinned by proprietary technology.

In 2016, we completed startup of the specialty elastomers project at our joint venture facility in Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Construction continued on a major expansion at our Texas facilities, including a new world-scale ethane cracker and polyethylene lines, to capitalize on low-cost feedstock and energy supplies in North America and to meet rapidly growing demand for premium polymers. Construction of new halobutyl rubber and hydrocarbon resin units also progressed in Singapore to further extend our specialty product capacity in Asia Pacific. The company also announced plans to expand its polyethylene plant in Beaumont, Texas, and specialty elastomers plant in Newport, Wales.

Upstream earnings were $196 million in 2016 and included an asset impairment charge of $2,027 million mainly related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains region of the U.S. Current year earnings were down $6,905 million from 2015. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $5.3 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million. The impairment charge reduced earnings by $2 billion. All other items increased earnings by $310 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items from the prior year. On an oil equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day was down slightly compared to 2015. Liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day increased 20,000 barrels per day with increased project volumes, mainly in Canada, Indonesia and Nigeria, partly offset by field decline, the impact from Canadian wildfires, and downtime notably in Nigeria. Natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day decreased 388 million cubic feet per day from 2015 as field decline, regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and divestments were partly offset by higher project volumes and work programs. U.S. Upstream earnings declined $3,072 million from 2015 to a loss of $4,151 million, and included the impairment charge of $2,027 million. Earnings outside the U.S. were $4,347 million, down $3,833 million from the prior year.

Upstream earnings were $7,101 million, down $20,447 million from 2014. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $18.8 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $810 million, including contributions from new developments. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion, primarily due to lower asset management gains and approximately $500 million of lower favorable one‑time tax effects, partly offset by lower expenses of about $230 million.  On an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day was up 3.2 percent compared to 2014. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day increased 234,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production of 10.5 billion cubic feet per day decreased 630 million cubic feet per day from 2014 as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by project ramp‑up, work programs and entitlement effects.  U.S. Upstream earnings declined $6,276 million from 2014 to a loss of $1,079 million in 2015. Earnings outside the U.S. were $8,180 million, down $14,171 million from the prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.

 

Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume‑determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.

 

Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.

 

Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.

 

Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.

 

Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2016, essentially in line with the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2016 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $22.3 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.3 billion, and a net debt increase of $4.3 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $16.2 billion, dividends to shareholders of $12.5 billion, the adjustment for non-cash deferred income tax credits of $4.4 billion, and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $1.4 billion.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2015, $1.0 billion lower than the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2015 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $18.0 billion for depreciation and depletion, and a net debt increase of $9.3 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $26.5 billion, the purchase of shares of ExxonMobil stock of $4.0 billion, dividends to shareholders of $12.1 billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.1 billion.

The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2016, the Corporation had unused committed short-term lines of credit of $5.5 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of $0.3 billion. Cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the Corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet the Corporation’s cash requirements and to optimize returns.

To support cash flows in future periods the Corporation will need to continually find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Averaged over all the Corporation’s existing oil and gas fields and without new projects, ExxonMobil’s production is expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the next few years. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.

The Corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start‑ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. The Corporation’s cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of risks.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

The Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Capital and exploration expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation anticipates an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. The Corporation is emerging from several years of high capital expenditure levels that supported major long-plateau production projects coming on line. Lower levels of capital spending over the next few years, partly due to cost savings and capital efficiencies, are not expected to delay major project schedules nor have a material effect on our volume capacity outlook.

Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments.

 

Cash Flow from Operating Activities

 

2016

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $22.1 billion in 2016, $8.3 billion lower than 2015. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, a decrease of $8.2 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion was $22.3 billion, up $4.3 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for net gains on asset sales was $1.7 billion while the adjustment for deferred income tax credits was $4.4 billion. Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2016 by $1.4 billion.

 

2015

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $30.3 billion in 2015, $14.8 billion lower than 2014. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, a decrease of $17.1 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion was $18.0 billion, up $0.8 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for net gains on asset sales was $0.2 billion compared to an adjustment of $3.2 billion in 2014. Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2015 by $3.1 billion.




Cash Flow from Investing Activities

 

2016

Cash used in investment activities netted to $12.4 billion in 2016, $11.4 billion lower than 2015. Spending for property, plant and equipment of $16.2 billion decreased $10.3 billion from 2015. Proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments of $4.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2015. Additional investments and advances were $0.8 billion higher in 2016.

 

2015

Cash used in investment activities netted to $23.8 billion in 2015, $3.2 billion lower than 2014. Spending for property, plant and equipment of $26.5 billion decreased $6.5 billion from 2014. Proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments of $2.4 billion compared to $4.0 billion in 2014. Additional investments and advances were $1.0 billion lower in 2015, while collection of advances was $2.5 billion lower in 2015.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

 

2016

Cash used in financing activities was $9.3 billion in 2016, $2.3 billion higher than 2015. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.98 per share from $2.88 per share and totaled $12.5 billion. Total debt increased $4.1 billion to $42.8 billion at year‑end. The first quarter issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt was partly offset by repayments of $8.0 billion in commercial paper and other short-term debt during the year.

ExxonMobil share of equity decreased $3.5 billion to $167.3 billion. The addition to equity for earnings was $7.8 billion. This was offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $12.5 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign exchange translation effects of $0.3 billion for the stronger U.S. currency reduced equity, while a $1.6 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.

During 2016, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired 12 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.0 billion. These purchases were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 4,156 million to 4,148 million at the end of 2016.

 

2015

Cash used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in 2015, $10.9 billion lower than 2014. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.88 per share from $2.70 per share and totaled $12.1 billion, a pay-out of 75 percent of net income. During the first quarter of 2015, the Corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt. Total debt increased $9.6 billion to $38.7 billion at year‑end.

ExxonMobil share of equity decreased $3.6 billion to $170.8 billion. The addition to equity for earnings was $16.2 billion. This was offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $15.1 billion, composed of $12.1 billion in dividends and $3.0 billion of share purchases of ExxonMobil stock to reduce shares outstanding. Foreign exchange translation effects of $8.2 billion for the stronger U.S. currency reduced equity, while a $3.6 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.

During 2015, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired 48 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $4.0 billion. These purchases were to reduce the number of shares outstanding and to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced by 1.1 percent from 4,201 million to 4,156 million at the end of 2015. Purchases were made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

This table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, because the Corporation is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “Note 19: Income, Sales-Based and Other Taxes”.

Notes:

(1)   Includes capitalized lease obligations of $1,225 million.

(2)   The amount due in one year is included in notes and loans payable of $13,830 million.

(3)   The fair value of asset retirement obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field life.

(4)   The amount by which the benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other postretirement plans at year-end. The payments by period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2017 and estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.

(5)   Minimum commitments for operating leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers, service stations and other properties. Total includes $836 million related to drilling rigs and related equipment.

(6)   Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. The undiscounted obligations of $21,580 million mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements.

(7)   Firm capital commitments represent legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements specifying all significant terms have been executed for the construction and purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. In certain cases where the Corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope, those commitments have been included to the extent that the amounts and timing of payments can be reliably estimated. Firm capital commitments, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled $10.4 billion, including $2.8 billion in the U.S. Firm capital commitments for the non-U.S. Upstream of $6.9 billion were primarily associated with projects in the United Arab Emirates, Africa, Malaysia, Canada, Australia and Norway. The Corporation expects to fund the majority of these commitments with internally generated funds, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

Guarantees

The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2016, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 

Financial Strength

On December 31, 2016, the Corporation’s unused short-term committed lines of credit totaled $5.5 billion (Note 6) and unused long-term committed lines of credit totaled $0.3 billion (Note 14). The table below shows the Corporation’s fixed-charge coverage and consolidated debt-to-capital ratios. The data demonstrate the Corporation’s creditworthiness.

Management views the Corporation’s financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation’s sound financial position gives it the opportunity to access the world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions, and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.

 

Litigation and Other Contingencies

As discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition. Refer to Note 16 for additional information on legal proceedings and other contingencies.

Capital and exploration expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation anticipates an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

Upstream spending of $14.5 billion in 2016 was down 43 percent from 2015, reflecting key project start-ups and capital efficiencies. Investments in 2016 included U.S. onshore drilling and world-class projects in Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia. The majority of expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 69 percent of total proved reserves at year‑end 2016, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.

Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.5 billion in 2016, a decrease of $0.2 billion from 2015, mainly reflecting lower refining project spending. Chemical capital expenditures of $2.2 billion decreased $0.6 billion from 2015 resulting from progression of major expansions.

Income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $48.9 billion in 2016, a decrease of $8.9 billion or 15 percent from 2015. Income tax expense, both current and deferred, was a credit of $0.4 billion, $5.8 billion lower than 2015, reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 13 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, favorable one-time items, and the impact of the U.S. Upstream impairment charge. Sales‑based and all other taxes and duties of $49.4 billion in 2016 decreased $3.1 billion.

 

2015

Income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $57.9 billion in 2015, a decrease of $25.0 billion or 30 percent from 2014. Income tax expense, both current and deferred, was $5.4 billion, $12.6 billion lower than 2014, as a result of lower earnings and a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 34 percent compared to 41 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Sales-based and all other taxes and duties of $52.5 billion in 2015 decreased $12.4 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.

Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2016 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $4.9 billion, of which $3.5 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $5 billion in 2017 and 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total.

Environmental Liabilities

The Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties. The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability exposure. At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial condition. Consolidated company provisions made in 2016 for environmental liabilities were $665 million ($371 million in 2015) and the balance sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $852 million as of December 31, 2016, and $837 million as of December 31, 2015.

Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the Upstream, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $400 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $150 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.

In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.

 
55 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial strength as a competitive advantage.

In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities. About 35 percent of the Corporation’s intersegment sales represent Upstream production sold to the Downstream. Other intersegment sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials, feedstocks and finished products.

Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation evaluates the viability of its major investments over a range of prices.

The Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives resulting in an efficient capital base.

 

Risk Management

The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. With respect to derivatives activities, the Corporation believes that there are no material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow or fair value. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.

The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and investment transactions. The impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates on ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied and often offsetting in amount. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures related to the Corporation’s limited use of the currency exchange contracts are not material.

 

Inflation and Other Uncertainties

The general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained moderate over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements. Beginning several years ago, an extended period of increased demand for certain services and materials resulted in higher operating and capital costs. More recently, multiple market changes, including general commodity price decreases, lower oil prices and reduced upstream industry activity, have contributed to lower prices for oilfield services and materials. The Corporation works to minimize costs in all commodity price environments through its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project management practices.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. “Sales and Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings. The Corporation expects to adopt the standard using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. The Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial statements. 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires that all leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and a lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it in 2019.  

 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies are summarized in Note 1.

 

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves

The estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessment, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, among other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves Group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in Item 2.

Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves.

·         Proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year.

Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances support a longer period of time.

The percentage of proved developed reserves was 69 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2016 (including both consolidated and equity company reserves), a reduction from 73 percent in 2015, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas prices.

·         Unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.

Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the

57 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity.

As a result of very low prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year‑end 2016. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, in Canada. In addition, 0.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of North America no longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to the acceleration of the projected end-of-field-life. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. We do not expect the downward revision of reported proved reserves under SEC definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes.

Supplemental information regarding oil and natural gas results of operations, capitalized costs and reserves is provided following the notes to consolidated financial statements.

 

Unit-of-Production Depreciation

Oil and natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to actual production. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability.

In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.

To the extent that proved reserves for a property are entirely de-booked and that property continues to produce, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a quantity of proved reserves greater than zero, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. The effect of this approach on the Corporation’s 2017 depreciation expense versus 2016 is anticipated to be immaterial.

 

Impairment

The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:

·         a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

·         a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes;

·         a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·         an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;

·         a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and

·         a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

The Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. These analyses and other profitability reviews assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.

In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management does not believe that lower prices are sustainable if energy is to be delivered with supply security to meet global demand over the long term. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining, but this is being offset by production from new discoveries and field developments. OPEC production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of global economic growth. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and

58 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.

When the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the Corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions. To the extent those changes result in a significant reduction in the mid-point of its long-term oil, natural gas price or margin ranges, the Corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events and changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of potential impairment for certain assets.

In the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.

If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.

An asset group is impaired if its undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is based on market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.

Continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak financial results for several assets in North America, and a reduction in the mid-point of the ranges of the Corporation’s long-term oil and natural gas prices developed as part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle led the Corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances supported performing an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets, notably North America natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its Upstream operations. The assessment reflected long-term crude and natural gas prices which are consistent with the mid-point of the ranges that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the range of long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry experts and government agencies. This assessment indicated that the vast majority of asset groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying values. However, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the United States exceeded the estimated cash flows. As a result, the Corporation’s fourth quarter 2016 results include an after-tax charge of $2 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States with large undeveloped acreage positions.

The assessment of fair values required the use of Level 3 inputs. The principal parameters used to establish fair values included estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8 percent depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market transactions. Due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets.

59 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

Inventories

Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO).

 

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations are disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.

 

Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. The facts and circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

 

Consolidations

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries that the Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain Upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in the underlying net assets of other significant entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Investments in companies that are partially owned by the Corporation are integral to the Corporation’s operations. In some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area of interest. The other parties, who also have an equity interest in these companies, are either independent third parties or host governments that share in the business results according to their ownership. The Corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet. In fact, the Corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned companies rather than only its interest in net equity. This method of accounting for investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by U.S. GAAP except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities. However, for purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not covered by U.S. GAAP standards, the Corporation includes its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in the determination of average capital employed.

 

Pension Benefits

The Corporation and its affiliates sponsor nearly 100 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.

Some of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets.

For funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.

60 

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

 

The Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

Pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2016 was 6.50 percent. The 10‑year and 20‑year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the long‑term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $160 million before tax.

Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.

 

Litigation Contingencies

A variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.

The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation revises such accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management believes should be disclosed.

Management judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.

 

Tax Contingencies

The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict.

The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.

Foreign Currency Translation

The method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is prescribed by GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiaries. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.

Factors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and significance of intercompany transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 

 
 

Management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Corporation’s financial reporting. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as stated in their report included in the Financial Section of this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 

 
 



To the Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity, and Cash Flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

The Corporation’s principal business is energy, involving the worldwide exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas (Upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products (Downstream). The Corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals (Chemical).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Prior years’ data has been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2016 presentation basis.

 

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in “Investments, advances and long-term receivables”. The Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income caption “Income from equity affiliates”.

Majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation and succession plans.

Evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence represents a loss in value of the Corporation’s investment that is other than temporary. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value.

The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

 

Revenue Recognition

The Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenues from the production of natural gas properties in which the Corporation has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of the Corporation’s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant.

Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.

 

Sales-Based Taxes

The Corporation reports sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income (included in both revenues and costs).

 

Derivative Instruments

The Corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities, nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.

70 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in income. In some cases, the Corporation designates derivatives as fair value hedges, in which case the gains and losses are offset in income by the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.

 

Fair Value

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.

 

Inventories

Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.

 

Property, Plant and Equipment

Cost Basis. The Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.

Under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016, the substantial majority of which relates to the Kearl oil sands operation, where no proved reserves remain. To the extent that proved reserves for a property are entirely de-booked and that property continues to produce, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a quantity of proved reserves greater than zero, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.

Investments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight‑line basis over a 25-year life. Service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over a 20-year life. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.

71 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Impairment Assessment. The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:

·         a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;

·         a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes;

·         a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·         an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;

·         a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and

·         a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

The Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. These analyses and other profitability reviews assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.

In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management does not believe that lower prices are sustainable if energy is to be delivered with supply security to meet global demand over the long term. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining, but this is being offset by production from new discoveries and field developments. OPEC production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of global economic growth. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.

When the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the Corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions. To the extent those changes result in a significant reduction in the mid-point of its long-term oil, natural gas price or margin ranges, the Corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events and changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of potential impairment for certain assets.

In the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.

If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.

An asset group is impaired if its undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is based on market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated

economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.

Other. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation. Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.

Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.

 

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities

The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.

Liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.

 

Foreign Currency Translation

The Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates.

Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and continental Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.

For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in income.

 

Stock-Based Payments

The Corporation awards stock-based compensation to employees in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is measured by the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period.

2. Accounting Changes

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. “Sales and Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings. The Corporation expects to adopt the standard using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. The Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard which are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires that all leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and a lease liability. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it in 2019.

Effective September 30, 2016, the Corporation early-adopted Accounting Standard Update no. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes on a prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. See Note 19.




3. Miscellaneous Financial Information

Research and development expenses totaled $1,058 million in 2016, $1,008 million in 2015 and $971 million in 2014.

5. Cash Flow Information

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides information about changes in cash and cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.

For 2016, the “Net (gain) on asset sales” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes before-tax amounts from the sale of service stations in Canada, the sale of Upstream properties in the U.S., and the sale of aviation fueling operations across multiple countries. For 2015, the number includes before-tax amounts from the sale of service stations in Europe, the sale of Upstream properties in the U.S., the sale of ExxonMobil’s interests in Chemical and Refining joint ventures, and the sale of the Torrance refinery. For 2014, the number includes before-tax gains from the sale of Hong Kong power operations, additional proceeds related to the 2013 sale of a partial interest in Iraq, the sale of Downstream affiliates in the Caribbean and the sale or exchange of Upstream properties in the U.S., Canada, and Malaysia. These net gains are reported in “Other income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In 2016, the “Additions/(reductions) in commercial paper, and debt with three months or less maturity” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes a net $608 million addition of commercial paper with maturity over three months. The gross amount issued was $3.9 billion, while the gross amount repaid was $3.3 billion. In 2015, the number includes a net $358 million addition of commercial paper with maturity over three months. The gross amount issued was $8.1 billion, while the gross amount repaid was $7.7 billion.

In 2015, ExxonMobil completed an asset exchange that resulted in value received of approximately $500 million including $100 million in cash. The non-cash portion was not included in the “Sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment” or the “All other items-net” lines on the Statement of Cash Flows. Capital leases of approximately $1 billion were not included in the “Additions to long-term debt” or “Additions to property, plant and equipment” lines on the Statement of Cash Flows.

In 2014, ExxonMobil completed asset exchanges, primarily non-cash transactions, of approximately $1.2 billion. This amount is not included in the “Sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment” or the “Additions to property, plant and equipment” lines on the Statement of Cash Flows.

7. Equity Company Information

The summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant management decisions (see Note 1). These companies are primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in North America; natural gas exploration, production and distribution in Europe; and exploration, production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, refining operations, petrochemical manufacturing, and fuel sales in Asia and the Middle East. Also included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing, and marketing ventures.

The Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in partnerships. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors giving rise to the difference. The amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in “income from equity affiliates”.

The share of total equity company revenues from sales to ExxonMobil consolidated companies was 14 percent, 15 percent and 14 percent in the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In 2013 and 2014, the Corporation and Rosneft established various entities to conduct exploration and research activities. Periods of disproportionate funding will result in the Corporation recognizing, during the early phases of the projects, an investment that is larger than its equity share in these entities. These joint ventures are considered Variable Interest Entities. However, since the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of these entities, the joint ventures are reported as equity companies. In 2014, the European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. With respect to the foregoing, each joint venture continues to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Corporation's maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures as of December 31, 2016, is $1.0 billion.

Continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak financial results for several assets in North America, and a reduction in the mid-point of the ranges of the Corporation’s long-term oil and natural gas prices developed as part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle led the Corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances supported performing an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets, notably North America natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its Upstream operations. The assessment reflected long-term crude and natural gas prices which are consistent with the mid-point of the ranges that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the range of long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry experts and government agencies. This assessment indicated that the vast majority of asset groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying values. However, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the United States exceeded the estimated cash flows. As a result, the Corporation’s fourth quarter 2016 results include a before-tax charge of $3.3 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States with large undeveloped acreage positions. The impairment charge is recognized in the line “Depreciation and depletion” on the Consolidated Statement of Income and recorded in “Accumulated depreciation and depletion”.

The assessment of fair values required the use of Level 3 inputs. The principal parameters used to establish fair values included estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8 percent depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market transactions. Due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets.

Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $209,691 million at the end of 2016 and $195,732 million at the end of 2015. Interest capitalized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $708 million, $482 million and $344 million, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.

Asset retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled. These obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. However, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.

The following table summarizes the activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:

10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

The following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of those costs.

13. Financial Instruments and Derivatives

Financial Instruments. The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease obligations, was $28.0 billion and $18.9 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $27.7 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2016.

The fair value of long-term debt by hierarchy level at December 31, 2016, is: Level 1 $27,825 million; Level 2 $137 million; and Level 3 $6 million.

Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivatives to mitigate the impact of such changes. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.

The estimated fair value of derivative instruments outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet was a net liability of $22 million at year-end 2016 and a net asset of $21 million at year-end 2015. Assets and liabilities associated with derivatives are usually recorded either in “Other current assets” or “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”.

The Corporation’s fair value measurement of its derivative instruments use either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs.

The Corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss) related to derivative instruments of $(81) million, $39 million and $110 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income statement effects associated with derivatives are usually recorded either in “Sales and other operating revenue” or “Crude oil and product purchases”. 

The Corporation believes there are no material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity as a result of the derivative activities described above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

14. Long-Term Debt

At December 31, 2016, long-term debt consisted of $28,257 million due in U.S. dollars and $675 million representing the U.S. dollar equivalent at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $2,960 million, which matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The increase in the book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion of long‑term debt in the first quarter of 2016. The amounts of long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, maturing in each of the four years after December 31, 2017, in millions of dollars, are: 2018 – $4,737; 2019 – $3,886; 2020 – $1,609; and 2021 – $2,540. At December 31, 2016, the Corporation’s unused long-term credit lines were $0.3 billion.
